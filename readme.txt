            -:   PORTFOLIO WEBSITE   :-

    A portfolio is a living and changing collection of records that reflect your accomplishments, skills, experiences, 
and attributes. It highlights and showcases samples of some of your best work, along with life experiences, values 
and achievements. The personal information that you incorporate into your portfolio can greatly reflect on your 
abilities as an individual as well as become a useful tool in marketing yourself to employers, corporations, 
colleges and universities. A portfolio does not take the place of a resume, but it can accentuate your abilities and
what you can offer in the chosen field.

    This Portfolio website is build by using HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript.
    
    And this website is hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud using static web app service. 
I wanted to use QnA maker and Azure bot services in my website, But my college has not purchased 
the Azure AD. For that, I don't have permission to create an app in the Azure portal
But, I have already created a QnA maker Knowledge Base and deployed it in the Azure portal.

    Using Github Student Developer pack, from NameCheap I have purchased the domain name for 
 my website and Replaced the domain which is provided (kind-field-080b44f00.1.azurestaticapps.net/) 
 from the azure when deployed the website with my domain as "bhaskars.me"  
    
You can find my website in Google by just typing bhaskars.me or https://bhaskars.me/
